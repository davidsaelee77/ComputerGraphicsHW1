TCSS Computer Graphics 458 - Homework 1, 2, and 3

HW Part 1:

The first piece of a renderer which can:

- draw lines and
- fill in solid triangles

Starting code was provided by instructor, which can be seen in the javadoc.

HW Part 2:

The renderer parses input file to do the following: 

- Uses 3D vertices (instead of 2D)
- Can include commands that translate, scale, and rotate (around the x,y,z axes)
- Can include both a unit wireframe cube and a unit solid cube as new drawing primitives
in addition to lines and triangles
- The user will be able to rotate whatever objects are described in the input
file around both the x and y axes using the up/down arrow keys and the left/right arrow keys respectively.

HW Part 3:

The renderer adds the following four features:

- Choice of Projection Type (Frustum or Ortho) and Camera Position/Orientation            
- Anti-Aliasing              
- Constant Shading with a Simple Light Model            
- Simple Clipping Based on X/Y Coordinates
